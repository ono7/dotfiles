A. Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving

Author: V. Anton Spraul
Verdict: 🏆 Best for "Freezing"

The Goal: This book directly addresses the issue of "I know the syntax, but I can't solve the problem."

Core Strategy: It teaches Problem Decomposition—how to take a scary problem and smash it into tiny, solvable pieces so you never have to "freeze."

Note: It uses C++ for examples, but you don't need to be a C++ expert. Read it for the strategies, not the code.

### notes

most constrained variable rule

- `most constrained variable rule` solve the variable that has the most constraints, this will be the variable that has the lowest number of possible values.

- reduce, divide, restate the problem are ways to find better soluctions to a problem faster
- dividing a problem can often lower its difficulty by a magnitude
- reducing a problem eliminates choice and makes it easier to find the correct solution(s)
- if you cant find division to a problem reduce it
- once its broken down into pieces, start by solving parts that you already know how to solve to make progress right away. having a working partial solution may give more ideas about solving the rest of the problem.
- start with what you know also applies to cases where the problem cant or has not been divided
- try to solve problems with tools you already know before going to other tools you dont yet know. like fixing problems at home, you first try the tools in your garage before heading to the hardware store to buy new ones.

- `reduce a problem` - reduce the scope of the problem when its not solvable right away, can we solve a small part of it
  first? by adding or revoming constraints to produce a problem that we know how to solve. for example, if we have to
  solve x,y,z coordinates on a 3d space to find if two coordinates are next to each other, what if we can solve x,y
  first, or just z

- `analogies` or similarities between problems that have already been solved or can be exploited to partially solve
  the current problems.

B. A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms

Author: Jay Wengrow
Verdict: 🏆 Best for "Core Concepts" (No Math)

The Goal: Most algorithm books use heavy math (Big O notation with proofs). This book explains complex concepts (Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs) using common sense and diagrams.

### notes

C. The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery

Authors: Andrew Hunt & David Thomas
Verdict: 🏅 Best for Professional Skills

The Goal: To transform you from a coder who writes working software into a developer who writes great software reliably and efficiently.

Core Strategy: Focuses on mindset, habits, testing, and team communication. Principles include the "DRY" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) and avoiding "software rot."
