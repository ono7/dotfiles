A. Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving

Author: V. Anton Spraul
Verdict: 🏆 Best for "Freezing"

The Goal: This book directly addresses the issue of "I know the syntax, but I can't solve the problem."

Core Strategy: It teaches Problem Decomposition—how to take a scary problem and smash it into tiny, solvable pieces so you never have to "freeze."

Note: It uses C++ for examples, but you don't need to be a C++ expert. Read it for the strategies, not the code.

B. A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms

Author: Jay Wengrow
Verdict: 🏆 Best for "Core Concepts" (No Math)

The Goal: Most algorithm books use heavy math (Big O notation with proofs). This book explains complex concepts (Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs) using common sense and diagrams.

C. The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery

Authors: Andrew Hunt & David Thomas
Verdict: 🏅 Best for Professional Skills

The Goal: To transform you from a coder who writes working software into a developer who writes great software reliably and efficiently.

Core Strategy: Focuses on mindset, habits, testing, and team communication. Principles include the "DRY" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) and avoiding "software rot."
